NOTE: For calling API you can use Altair or Postman.

In architect I used 5 Layer. 
1) Test Layer :
   - XUnit used for implement test
  - SQL Lighter used for mocking DB
  - Auto fixture added for creating mock Data (I did not use that anywhere. Due of less time)
2) Rectangle Api Layer :
  - For APIs I used GraphQL. Mutations.cs Api uses for manipulating data. Query.cs APIs used for Get data.
  - Also added ErrorHandlerMiddleware for handle type of Errors.

3) Domain Layer to keep Domain entities.
 - Just for create Foreign key and Index in DB I created this additional table.

4) Domain.Services Layer for Services for each domain. 
   - This will make testability more efficient
   - Actions will happen there. And maintainability will be easy.
5) Persistence Layer for Entity framework related actions.

 - In the migration folder, there is a migration for adding seed data - 200 rectangles into DB
 - In there I used UnitOfWork Pattern and Factory Pattern with IAuditContextFactory. Each of them can be used to manipulate DB objects.
 -  AuditContext is used to make Entities auditable. In every table additional columns will be like "CreatedDate , LastModifiedDate" and they will set automatically
  

Please please for understanding, take a look at the project and Architect. I really give effort to complete it.
